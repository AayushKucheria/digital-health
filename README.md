# Epileptic Seizure Detection with EEG Signals

## Abstract

Measuring health parameters and vital signs of patients has become more convenient, mobile, and cheaper. This is due to the technological advancements in portable diagnostics, algorithms, and sensors. We are building a prototype that measures, logs, and analyzes EEG signals continuously using Emotiv wearables.. We measure the brain activity of patients with the form of EEG signals, and use that data to detect the symptoms of diseases like Epilepsy. At the moment, the prototype is able to detect epileptic seizures of the wearer via two models, Pyramidal 1-Dimensional Convolutional neural network (P1D-CNN) deep-learning model and unsupervised K-means Clustering model, which both give promising results of above 80% and 90%. With both models up and running, they were integrated into the web application. From the web application, one can access a personâ€™s data or add more data in. Aside from viewing the data, one can also view the result output of the two models diagnosing epileptic seizures.
